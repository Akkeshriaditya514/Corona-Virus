<h1>“How to stay safe from COVID19”</h1>

<h2>Clean your hands often</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
  <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
  <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Avoid close contact</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick</li>
  <li>Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Take steps to protect others</h1>

<h2>Stay home if you’re sick</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cover coughs and sneezes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>
  <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
  <li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wear a facemask if you are sick</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
<li>If you are NOT sick: You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clean and disinfect</h2>

<ul>
<li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>
<li>If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.</li>
</ul>
